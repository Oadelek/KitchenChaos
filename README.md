# 🍳 KitchenChaos: My Culinary Coding Adventure 🥘

Hey there👋

Welcome to my implementation of the CodeMonkey Unity tutorial game, KitchenChaos. It's like Hell's Kitchen, but with more C# and less Gordon Ramsay yelling at you (though I can't promise the code won't make you want to yell sometimes 😅).

## What's Cooking?

This repo is my attempt to follow along with CodeMonkey's Unity tutorial, creating a chaotic kitchen simulator that's part cooking show, part time management nightmare, and 100% fun (at least that's what I keep telling myself as I debug at 2 AM).

## Features (or "What's on the Menu?")

- Pixelated food that looks almost good enough to eat (but please don't)
- More kitchen timers than you can shake a spatula at
- Customers with the patience of saints (thankfully)
- Code that's messier than my actual kitchen (and that's saying something)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo (or fork it, if you're feeling fancy)
2. Open it in Unity (version: whatever I happened to be using)
3. Press Play and watch the culinary chaos unfold
4. Try not to burn down the virtual kitchen (or your actual computer)

## Disclaimer

This game may or may not improve your actual cooking skills. Side effects may include a sudden urge to organize your kitchen cupboards and an irrational fear of onions.

## Credits

Massive thanks to CodeMonkey for the awesome tutorial. If this implementation is a kitchen disaster, it's totally on me – their tutorial is top-notch!

## Final Notes

Hope you enjoy this digital dive into kitchen madness! Feel free to fork, star, or send me your favorite recipes. And remember, in both coding and cooking, if at first you don't succeed, order pizza. 🍕

Happy coding and bon appétit! 🍽️👨‍🍳👩‍🍳
